### React with GraphQL

---


A basic application in which users can signup,login, verify their accounts and implement CRUD operations on Item resources.

The Figma design for the application can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/YDc7gQSwJH7KnjkErlqXZo/Wazobia-Test?node-id=301%3A159 "here").  To build this application you will connecting to a test api which is deployed at [test-api.sytbuilder.com](https://test-api.sytbuilder.com "test-api.sytbuilder.com"). The API is implemented in both REST and GraphQL. The REST documentation can be found at [test-api.sytbuilder.com](https://test-api.sytbuilder.com "test-api.sytbuilder.com") while you can view the GraphQL documentation in a GraphQL desktop client at [test-api.sytbuilder.com/graphql](https://test-api.sytbuilder.com/graphql "test-api.sytbuilder.com/graphql"). We highly recommend [Firecamp](https://firecamp.io/graphql "Firecamp"). They have an excellent Chrome Extension.
